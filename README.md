# ONS baby names: complete dataset

This repository provides a unified dataset of baby names registered in England and Wales, combining all available datasets published by the [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/). It includes:

- Boys‚Äô names
- Girls‚Äô names
- Historic top 100 names
- Breakdowns by England, Wales, and England and Wales jointly

## üì¶ Overview

The ONS publishes separate datasets for boys and girls, as well as a historical summary of the top 100 names going back decades. These datasets are spread across multiple Excel files and formats, with slight structural differences over time.

This repo fetches, cleans, and consolidates these into a tidy, long-format dataset for analysis and reuse.
